# Available Agents

## Overview

The ai-instructions project includes 90 specialized agents to enhance your AI development workflow. These agents can be deployed using the `agents deploy` command.

## Main Orchestrator

### üåà orchestrator

## Agent Dependencies

Some agents work better together:
- `test-writer-fixer` + `code-reviewer` - Quality assurance team
- `ui-designer` + `frontend-developer` - Design implementation
- `orchestrator` + any specialists - Complex multi-domain tasks
- `trend-researcher` + `tiktok-strategist` - Viral content creation

## Notes

- For Claude Code: Agents are deployed as MD files to `./.claude/agents/` directory
- For other tools: Agents can be deployed to `./agents/` directory
- Use `agents list` to see all available agents
- Use `agents info <name>` for detailed agent information
- Use `agents deploy-all` to deploy all agents at once
- The orchestrator can coordinate multiple agents automatically
