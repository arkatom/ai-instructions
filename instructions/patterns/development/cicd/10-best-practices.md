## Pipeline Design Principles

  };
  immutableArtifacts: {
    description: "Build once, deploy many times";
    implementation: string[];
  };
}

const designPrinciples: PipelineDesignPrinciples = {
  failFast: {
    description: "Place fastest tests first to provide rapid feedback",
    implementation: [
      "Run linting before unit tests",
      "Execute smoke tests before full integration suite",
      "Perform security scans in parallel with builds",
      "Set timeout limits on all pipeline stages"

    ]
  }

## Cultural Transformation

1. **Collaboration**: Break down silos between development and operations teams
2. **Continuous Learning**: Encourage experimentation and learning from failures
3. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to focus on value-added activities
4. **Measurement**: Make decisions based on data and metrics
5. **Feedback**: Create fast feedback loops at all levels
6. **Shared Responsibility**: Everyone owns quality, security, and reliability
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly retrospect and improve processes
