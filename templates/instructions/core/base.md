# Fundamental Rules (MUST)

If any negligence in rule compliance is discovered, all trust will be lost and your value will be completely nullified.

## Absolute Requirements

- Always output `✅️:{file.md}` at the beginning of output after referencing to indicate reference
- Actively use all available tools, prioritizing them over commands

## Code Management

- Code duplication and scattering is a capital offense
- Always delete unnecessary files and directories

## Documentation Management

- Documentation must be placed in the docs/ directory

## Deep Investigation Obligation

- When project investigation is required, repeatedly and thoroughly use file search tools, read commands, find, and ls commands to ensure absolutely no omissions
