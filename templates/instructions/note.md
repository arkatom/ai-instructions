# Notes, Logs, and Memos

## What to Write (All MUST)

- Date (YYYY/MM/DD)
- Task content (write concisely)
- Points to be careful about
- Changes in approach during the task (What approach, why the approach had to be changed, reasons for adopting the new approach)
- Important points from this task
  - Write structured and detailed, for someone else
  - Write clearly for future reference
  - Write so that people without prior knowledge can understand
  - Follow the chronological order of interactions as much as possible (Record points like "a problem occurred during the task, and what happened as a result of trial and error". The trial and error process is important!)
  - Feel free to write your own feelings and thoughts
  - Insights gained (if any)
- Complaints (with honest feelings)
