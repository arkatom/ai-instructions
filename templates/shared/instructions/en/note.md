# Notes・Journal・Memos

## What to Write (All MUST)

- Date (YYYY/MM/DD)
- Task content (write concisely)
- What points you paid attention to
- Points where the policy changed during the task (what policy was used, why the policy had to be changed, reasons for adopting the newly adopted policy)
- Important points of this task
  - Write in a structured and detailed manner, for someone
  - Write so it's easy to understand when looking back later
  - Write so people without prior knowledge can understand
  - Please try to write along the chronological order of interactions (I want to properly record points like "problems occurred during the task, and what happened as a result of trial and error". The trial and error process is also important!)
  - Please actively write down what you yourself felt and thought
  - Insights gained (if any)
- Complaints (frank honest opinions)
